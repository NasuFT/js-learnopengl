# JS-LearnOpenGL

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

An implementation of [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) codes and lessons to WebGL 1.

As LearnOpenGL is based on OpenGL 3.3 (Core-profile), some of the functions/concepts needed are not found on WebGL 1 which is based on OpenGL ES 2.0.

One of these concepts that is encountered early on are the use of `Vertex Attribute Objects (VAO)` which is not present in base WebGL 1. It is present as an extension in WebGL 1, and as a core functionality in WebGL 2 (based on OpenGL ES 3.0).

This project was created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
